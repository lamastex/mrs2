	/*! \brief Create an estimate of the function described by fobj using a 
	depth-first brute force approach.
	
	The over all aim to create an estimate of the described by fobj
	such that each of the leaf nodes of the subpaving managed by this
	has a box associated with it
	that meets the <b>interval image tolerance requirement</b> specified
	by \a tolerance.  

	The interval image tolerance requirement
	is that the diameter of the interval image of the box associated
	with any leaf node of of the subpaving managed by this
	should be less than or equal to the tolerance.
	 
	But in some cases this can result in boxes being split beyond the limits
	of the real number screen.  If a split of a leaf node that does not
	meet the interval image tolerance requirement would result in
	the child nodes' volumes being < the value of the cxsc::MinReal (the 
	smallest representable real number) then that leaf will not be split.

	This means that after the operation, the subpaving managed by this
	may have leaf nodes where the interval image tolerance requirement 
	is not met. 
	
	This operation works depth first, ie working from a leaf root
	it will successively split the root then the root's left child
	and that child's, left child, etc.  It will only start
	splitting the right child of any node already split when all the
	descendents of the left child meet the interval image tolerance
	requirement (or they cannot 
	be split further).  This may cause the machine to run out of memory
	before the process is completed.   
	 
	\note If this operation is applied to this when the subpaving managed
	by this already has leaf nodes which exceed the interval
	image tolerance requirement, those leaf nodes will be left unaltered
	by this operation.
