	The interval image tolerance requirement
	is that the diameter of the interval image of the box associated

	But in some cases this can result in boxes being split beyond the limits

	the child nodes' volumes being < the value of the cxsc::MinReal (the

	may have leaf nodes where the interval image tolerance requirement 
	is not met. 
	
	This operation works depth first, ie working from a leaf root

	splitting the right child of any node already split when all the

	an estimate with at most \a maxLeaves leaves is created which 
	is approximately as close as possible to the requirments of \a checker.
	It is only approximately as close as possible
	because although the method works across the current leaves of the
	same depth or level first before
	descending (ie level by level),

    These methods takes an estimator and progressively split using a

	to determine which node to split first.  The ordering for 
	the queue is referred to here as the measure.
	
	The measure used is the reduction in the 'area' of the the interval
	band on each piece of the current function estimate resulting 
	from a division of the piece into two halves.  The area of a piece
	is the diameter of the interval image of the piece multiplied 
	by the area of the piece (leaf) box.  The reduction of this
	area resulting from a split of a piece is (area of band
	for current piece) - (sum of areas of bands for 
	the two halves of the piece that would result from dividing
	that piece in half). Pieces with the largest 'gain' measured in
	this way will be split first. Note that <b>this does not 
	provide a globally optimal</b> ordering for the queue: this ordering
	only looks one step ahead and does not take account of large 
	potential gains that might result from further bisections of the
	current pieces even if the first bisection does not provide a
	large immediate gain.  In particular, if the 
	function over some piece is completely symmetrical in two consecutive
	dimensions then the potential gain on bisection on the first of
	these will be calculated as 0 (because the interval enclosures 
	of both halves of the current piece will be the same as the interval
	enclosure of the current piece itself).  The bivariate Gaussian

	completely non-globally optimal behaviour.  
	   
	Splitting continues until
    some criteria specified by the function evaluator \a fe
	(applying either to individual nodes or to the estimator
    as a whole) is satisfied, or there are no more splittable nodes.

    Each node in the subpaving managed by this decides for itself 
	whether it is splittable, using isSplittableNode().

    If more than one splittable node is equally 'large', on the basis of the
	measure  used, then a random choice is made between all equally
    large nodes to find the node which will be split.

    The seed for the random number generator used for random
	selection between equally
    'large' nodes can be specified by the user or set by this.
	If you are looking at distributions of results across
    multiple histograms, supply the random number generator seed
	to the priority queue to ensure that each estimator
	will make different random choices

	results each time.

    These methods takes an estimator and progressively merge using a 
	priority queue of mergeable nodes 
	to determine which node to merge first.  The ordering for 
	the queue is referred to here as the measure.
	
	The measure used is the increase in the 'area' of the the interval
	band on each cherry piece of the current function estimate resulting 
	from a merge of two halves of the piece.  This is seen as a loss
	in the sense of being a loss in the tightness of the function
	enclosure, or an increase in the Reimann Difference.  The area of a piece
	is the diameter of the interval image of the piece multiplied 
	by the area of the piece (leaf) box.  The loss of tightness
	resulting from a merge of two halves of a piece is (area of band
	for merged piece) - (sum of areas of bands for 
	the two halves of the piece). Pieces with the smallest 'loss' measured in
	this way will be merged first. Note that <b>this does not 
	provide a globally optimal</b> ordering for the queue.
	   
	Merging continues until
    some criteria specified by the function evaluator \a fe
	(applying either to individual nodes or to the estimator
    as a whole) is satisfied, or there are no more mergeable nodes.

    If more than one mergeable node is equally 'small', on the basis of the
	measure  used, then a random choice is made between all equally
    small nodes to find the node which will be merged.

     The seed for the random number generator used for random
	selection between equally
    'small' nodes can be specified by the user or set by this.
	If you are looking at distributions of results across
    multiple estimates, supply the random number generator seed
	to the priority queue to ensure that each estimator
	will make different random choices
	each time; use of the internally set seed will give the same
	results each time.
