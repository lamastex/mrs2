\brief Global Optimisation declarations.
Global optimisation using the C++ Toolbox for Verified Computing
See Hammer, R., Hocks, M., Kulisch, U., and Ratz, D (1995),
C++ Toolbox for Verified Computing, Springer, pp. 312-342

This routine uses a global variable.  This is not ideal but seems, on
balance, to be the most sensible way around the problems of having a
polymorphic implemention of AllGop, ie one that can take some function object
and use the appropriate method of that function object as the HTscalar_FctPtr
needed by AllGop.  Ideally, we would take an fObj as the parameter and use
its HTscalar_FctPtr method directly but to do that we have to bind 'this',
the function object, into the call to the method.  That is possible, but in
this case the signature of the HTscalar_FctPtr type, as defined for AllGop,
is HessType (*) (const HTvector&) and using the basic
stl functional binders, we can't bind to when one of the arguments is a
reference.  We could get around this by using the std::tr1::function binders,
which have wrappers for references, but this would mean that the process
would only compile and run where some implementation of tr1 is available and
this would be a severe limitiation.  If and when tr1 is 'officially'
implemented, we could clean all this up and get rid of the global.  We have
to use a pointer to an Fobj as the global because Fobj is an abstract class
and so cannot be declared on just as Fobj.  But in this only when the other
arguments
