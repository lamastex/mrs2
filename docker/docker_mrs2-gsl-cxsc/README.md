This Step 1 is already done and can be pulled from docker hub as raazesh/mrs2-gsl-cxsc.
If you want to redo it from source then do the following.

### build mrs2-gsl
```
make build-gsl
```

Next, push this to dockerhub lamastex/mrs2-gsl.

```
$ docker tag lamastex/mrs2-gsl:latest
$  docker images # make sure image is tagged correctly
$  docker login # login to docker
$  docker push lamastex/mrs2-gsl:latest
```

because cxsc needs interactive build we will call

```
make run-gsl-cxsc 
```
and 


```%sh
$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
e2564d53e479        mrs2-gsl            "/bin/bash"         14 minutes ago      Up 14 minutes                           mrs2-gsl-cxsc
```
### commit mrs2-gsl-cxsc, login and push to dockerhub
Now, you can commit this image **after** it has been built with c-xsc library that requires interaction during its build, as detailed further below on 'how to build mrs2-gsl-cxsc'.

```%sh
$ docker commit mrs2-gsl-cxsc lamastex/mrs2-gsl-cxsc
sha256:089db06cd01bd2ab9e09eaf7a8945945f13a99911397e0a57c814b60bcac68c1

$ docker images
REPOSITORY              TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
